    <h1>AuraBar Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 27, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>AuraBar does not collect personally identifiable information. The app only stores the mood text,
  stickers, background colors, and similar preferences you choose. These settings are kept locally on
  your device and synchronized between the main app and its widgets/Live Activity via Apple’s App Groups.
  Purchase status is validated by Apple’s StoreKit receipts; this information stays on your device and
  Apple’s servers and is never uploaded to third-party services.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use and Share Data</h2>
    <p>All settings data is used solely to render the app, widgets, and Live Activity experiences. We do
  not share any information with third parties. AuraBar does not embed third-party analytics, advertising,
  or tracking SDKs.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app relies on Apple frameworks such as StoreKit, ActivityKit, and WidgetKit, and adheres to
  Apple’s privacy policies. Purchases, downloads, and refunds made through the App Store are processed
  directly by Apple; we never receive your payment details.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>All configuration data remains on your device. You can erase it by deleting the app or using the
  in-app “Reset” option. Sandbox or production purchase receipts are stored by Apple and can be restored
  at any time through “Restore Purchases.”</p>

    <h2>5. Children and Age Restrictions</h2>
    <p>AuraBar is rated 4+ and does not collect personal data that could identify children.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any privacy-related questions, contact us at <a
